# bachelor_project

All of the files of my Bachelor project, which resulted in my thesis.


The Python script is used for the first steps in preprocessing of Neotoma datasets.
All the created datasets (preprocessed, 100%, 1%, 0.5% and PSE) are found in the folder Datasets. I don't have the rights to the raw data, those can be downloaded from their respective sources mentioned in my thesis.
All of the R-scripts are used to create the results.
